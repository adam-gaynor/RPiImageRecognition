# RPiImageRecognition
  The Raspberry Pi camera module will be used during this project to attempt image recognition and storage for later use. The camera module does not contain an infrared filter and thus will be able to pick up IR light with the use of reflective tape. An IR LED will then be used to strobe at a certain frequency so that the PI picks up the image data for processing. This data will be stored for later use and later interpreted. The OpenCV C/C++ library will be used for image processing and storage. The 
interpreting of the image will be done in either C++ or Python.
